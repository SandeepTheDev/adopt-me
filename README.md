## Virtual DOM vs Real DOM

DOM stands for Document Object Model. Its a tree like structure that represents the all nodes in the HTML document. React uses something called Virtual DOM to update Real DOM efficiently. Whenever the state of application changed React create a Virtual DOM with updated state and compares it with previous Virtual DOM and then sync it with Real DOM efficiently this process of comparision and updating the Real DOM is also known as **Diffing**. And the algorithm that is used to compare DOMs is **Diffing Algorithm.**
